AI Case Study for Module 1 Challenge 


# Module 1 Challenge - Case Study 
>By Mary Pulley

### Overview and Origin

* National Institutes of Health (NIH)

NIH was established as a one room laboratory in the Marine Hospital Service (MHS) in 1798 by President John Adams to provide medical care for merchant seamen, especially in detecting infectious diseases like cholera and yellow fever to prevent epidemics ~1, 2~. It later became the U.S Public Health Service in 1912 and was renamed as the National Institutes of Health in 1930 ~3~. The NIH of today as established by the National Institutes of Health Reform Act of 2006 submits a biennial report to Congress and the NIH's organization is reviewed by a Scientific Management Review Board every 7 years ~3~. NIH primarily supports biomedical research aimed at improving health and is a subdivision in the United States Department of Health and Human Services.  According to the NIH Grants and Funding page, the NIH is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world, spending most of the 48 billion annual budget in medical research ~5~.

### Business Activities
The NIH mission as stated on their website is "to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability." ~6~ As movement towards that mission the NIH emphasis is on research dedicated towards improving the health of people in the United States. The market size of customers therefore would be the population of the United States, estimated as of this writing at 345,987,446 by Worldometer, ~7~. Since the NIH is a government run institution, it's unfair advantage is funding size and ubiquity. As part of the massiveness that is the NIH, the technology that they are using relevant to this case study is AI and the guidelines of how to use AI and ML, especially given privacy concerns in medical research and clinical trials. The NIH standard for making their data available for AI use is abbreviated as FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ~8~. There have been two events this year alone on AI Readiness and AI Ethics, and a lot of the material on the NIH website is geared towards ethical considerations in using AI for NIH datasets ~9~. Ways AI is being used can range from assisting in diagnosis by the constant monitoring of patient systems from wearable devices to interpretation of enhanced imaging systems to detect minute changes to improve cancer or Alzheimer's screenings ~10~. Because the NIH is such a huge system it's difficult to quantify without looking through literally thousands of research grants and papers. On a quick scan there were instances of studies where researchers use AI in studying rare diseases because the AI can use pattern recognition for finding instances of genetic mutation that are unknown and therefore not as studied ~11~, or AI algorithms and medical professionals were both given the same information and asked to correctly diagnose a patient and explain the reasoning and circumstances. Interestingly the AI scored well on diagnosis but badly on explaining the reasoning ~12~

### Landscape
The NIH primarily distributes funding for biomedical research but it also provides oversight and guidelines on what federal regulations (CFR) or ethical considerations in biomedical research ~13~. Over the last 5-10 years the major trends include an increase in technology related studies - Bioengineering, Assistive Technology, Machine Learning/AI, Biotechnology, Networking and Information Technology, Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Telehealth, etc but also big increases in Comparative Effectiveness Research, Data Science, Complementary and Integrative Health, Dissemination and Implementation Research, Health Disparities, Health Services, Genetics,  Precision Medicine, Prevention, Social Determinants of Health, Workforce Diversity and Outreach, and obviously COVID research  ~14~. In terms of funding changes, the general trend shows the budget increase every year by due to incremental funding for R&D designated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, other then 2011 due to federal budget decisions in 2011 ~15~.  Although pharmaceutical companies account for almost three quarters of American R&D expenditures, other major companies other than NIH sponsoring medical research include other government agencies like the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Department of Defense (DOD), Behind pharmaceutical comapanies and government agencies are institutions of higher education and special interest gouprs or nonprofits that make up the rest of the major players of medical research spending ~16~. Philanthropic groups especially contribute significant support to research but often with very narrow objectives, while institutions of higher education invest most strongly in basic research after federal fundinhg ~17~.
### Results
The business impact of NIH funding policies according to their website is an increase in life expectancy and decrease in death rate - the examples on the splash page include the life expectancy of the average American increased by 6 years between 1970 and 2020 from 70.8 to 77.0, and the death rate in the United States for all causes during the same time period decreased 35%, from 1279 per 100,000 people to 835 ~18~. In economic impact, for fiscal year 2022 it is estimated that NIH funding generated an estimated $96.84 billion in economic activity, whereevbery $1 in NIH funding returned approximately $2.64 of economic activity ~19~. Measuring Return on Investment for medical research funding can be less straightforward than in other areas as ROI should be assessed with more nebulous data like improved quality of life or better outcomes for medical intervention, rather than just economic indicators (How can you measure the return on investment for biomedical research funding? ~20, 21, 22~. Because of these issues it's hard to tell exactly how the NIH performs relative to say the DOD with out of the box metrics
### Recommendations
As an advisor to the NIH my suggestions would be that the concentration on emerging technologies is an important component of future research. As you can see above in the Landscape section there are some emerging technologies and concerns that are being researched more heavily, and these appear to be able to tentatively be divided into two categories - emerging technology and social change. Emerging technologies would be things like AI and Machine Learning, Assistive Technologies, Nanotechnology, etc while social change categories would be things like Health Disparities, Workforce Diversity and Outreach, or Social Determinants of Health - research into issues that may have been known some time but weren't considered as relevant to society but are more recognized as important issues now. All companies are adaptive to be able to respond to changing business climates, and the NIh is no different. As part of adapting to the current research climate, if I were a decision maker at the NIH, I would advise that they offer a training course to their grant applicants on how emerging technologies - most notably automation and AI - can streamline the grant and research process and hopefully save time and money. As someone who has done scientific research, data processing can be a low hanging fruit ripe for automation, and newer technologies like Machine Learning can really make a difference in how data is processed. While many labs have a dedicated data scientist, it is more common to have a worker who is doing data processing in addition to other research duties (like I was doing). Offering a service where a designated data scientist trained in Machine Language and AI who can write code to automate data processing can dedicate a certain amount of time to a project as part of the grant funding process would be a huge time saver for a lot of research labs. AI and Machine Learning are changing the landscape of how we interact with the world, and research is another area where great strides can be made in conserving resources so that increased strides can be made. The last research lab I worked at was looking into these solutions in 2018 or so, and new and innovative solutions have been implemented since then.
